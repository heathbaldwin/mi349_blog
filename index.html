            <h2>Heading to Eguene, Oregon</h2>
            <p><img src="haywardpic.png" alt="Picture of Oregon Track"></p>
            <p>This week I will be heading to Eugene, Oregon where I will be competing in the NCAA outdoor track and field national 
                championship. I qualified for this meet by have one of the top 24 scores in the entire NCAA in the decathlon. 
                We are going to be flying out of the Detroit airport to Portland. From Portland we will drive to Eugene, Oregon where the 
                University of Oregon will host the track meet on their world-class track facility as seen in the picture above. This 
                will be my second time going to this meet and first time for Michigan State. Last year I qualified for the meet in my first 
                outdoor track season at the University of Michigan, where I spent my first two years. I feel a lot more comfortable going 
                into this meet compared to last year. I feel that I have not put together a good decathlon yet this year, but my body has 
                been feeling excellent lately at practice and I am excited to give it another go. My goal is to be a first team All 
                American. To do this I have to place in the top 8 people at the meet. I am ready to go for Eugene!</p>

            <h2>Recap of the Big Ten Championship Meet </h2>
            <p><img src="minnesotapic.png" alt="Picture of Minnesota Track"></p>
            <p>This year the Big Ten outdoor track championship meet was held at the University of Minnesota. I went in to this 
                meet looking to crown myself a Big Ten champion and win the decathlon, but it seems the higher ups have bigger 
                plans for me. I ended up taking third place in the decathlon after a long two days. During this decathlon I had 
                a great start by hitting a PR in the 100-meter dash. The momentum shifted quickly as I jumped once of my worst 
                jumps in the long jump, high jump and did not throw very well in the shot put. The finish a dreadful day 1 I 
                also ran a bad time in the 400-meter dash. Despite a terrible day one I came back and put together one of my 
                best day twos I have ever had. I ended up hitting a massive PR in the discus along with good showings in the 
                javelin and the 1500-meter run. I was very proud of myself for coming back on day two and putting a good day 
                together despite my terrible day one. I think this meet was a positive learning experience and will make me 
                stronger going into the national championship meet.</p>
